# Quail_inversion_scripts
This repository contains perl scripts for calculating dxy inside and outside of an inversion between common quails with and without the inversion. Used in Sanchez-Donoso et al, 2021, Science. UNDER REVIEW

The scripts were written to take a vcf file as input and calculate absolute divergence (dxy) between a subset of samples that have the inversion and a subset of samples without the inversion, based on the number of pairwise differences between the sample and the length of the region being considered.
